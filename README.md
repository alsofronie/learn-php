# Learn PHP

This project is intended for absolute beginners to learn the PHP language. Of course, there are
some other languages and / or technologies included in order to become a good PHP developer. Some
of these are:

 - How a HTTP server works
 - HTML
 - SQL (the MySQL variant, easily adapted to other servers)
 - CSS (and SCSS later)
