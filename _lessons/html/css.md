# HTML and CSS
### Lesson 4.

Take a look at the [source file](https://github.com/alsofronie/learn-php/blob/master/sources/simple-navbar.html) for a bery basic navbar with an interesting functionality: an active element (with the help of CSS `:hover`) that interacts with the visitor.

Do not think this is an active or decision-logic implementation. This cannot be done in HTML. The absolutely positioned element is basically shown or hidden based on the mouse hovering over an element, but the actual structure of the HTML remains the same.
